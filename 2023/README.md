5. Proposal Title

pyhf Users and Developers Workshop 2023

6. Two Sentence Summary of Proposal

Given the rise in adoption of pyhf across multiple subfields of experimental and theoretical particle physics the pyhf development team is holding the inaugural pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/).
This workshop will support the growth and empowerment of the particle physics developer community that contributes to pyhf development and would benefit from having costs offset by this award.

DEBUG: Currently at 669 words.

## Motivation

The pyhf user community has grown extensively since the project inception in 2018, covering many different subfields of particle physics experiment, theory, and computation.
In 2019 the ATLAS collaboration at CERN in Switzerland (focused on high energy physics) used pyhf and its JSON model specification to publish the first full probability model of a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) analysis, and has since gone on to use pyhf in over 24 publications.
With this success, and pyhf's continued development, there has been wide adoption of pyhf in the broader particle physics community.
The Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) has adopted pyhf as a component of its plan for the next generation of particle physics analysis software.
Most recently, the Belle II experimental collaboration in Japan (focused on lower energy precision physics) has published multiple analyses using pyhf, and the MicroBooNE experimental collaboration (focused on neutrino physics) is also beginning to use pyhf.
The particle physics phenomenology theory community has also be quick adopters of pyhf, using the library as an inference engine to build their workflows around.
These communities represent a broad collection of subfields of particle physics, with different needs and goals, with hundreds of pyhf users each.

While the community of pyhf users has been steadily growing, the number of regular pyhf contributors has not grown substantially beyond the three core developers.
Through interacting with the users and contributors in the broader particle physics community it has become clear to the pyhf core development team that it is important for the project to better understand the varied needs of the users and seek additional project developers.
To better facilitate inter-experimental discussions and to understand what will benefit the pyhf user community the most the pyhf development team will hold the inaugural pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/).
Additionally, the workshop will be used to onboard new contributors and to have the explicit goal of growing the pyhf development team to better support new feature development.

## Planned work and costs

Particle physics workshops have a format of a small conference in which the first days contain introductory talks on the state of the field and demonstrations.
In addition to providing video recordings for these talks it is important that the recordings are professional captioned to make them accessible to the deaf members of our community, as well as more accessible in general.

The workshop will be split into two parts: A section focusing on the pyhf user community and a following section focused on growing the developer community.

The rest of the approximately week workshop will be devoted to planning discussions to better understand the needs of the user community, the

As the users of pyhf are globally distributed the decision to hold a workshop at CERN was made as it is a common international meeting place and CERN users (including the pyhf development team) are allowed to use CERN facilities and resources for meetings without any cost.
However, travel costs to CERN can be substantial, leading to CERN meeting attendance being disproportionately represented from larger European institutions.
To have a successful workshop with diverse user community representation we plan to use the majority of this award to provide travel support, with preference given to Ph.D. candidates and early career researchers at institutions outside of Europe.

## Risks

The risks for successful execution of the workshop are few, given the experience of the organizers in planning and executing similar workshops for many years and the communicated level of interest from the boarder particle physics community.
The primary risk would be lack of attendance and contributions from primary user groups in the community and groups that would be well suited to be new developers.
These risks will be mitigated by communicating in advance with the user groups and by advertising the workshop across the various particle physics community mailing lists and meetings, and the monthly NumFOCUS newsletter, at the end of Summer 2023.

DEBUG: REVISE

## Impact to the project

For pyhf as a project the workshop offers an opportunity for synchronous interaction with the largest user groups and the pool of people more probable to continue making contributions and become future developers.
This is crucial for the continued development and growth of the project.
Given the limited time of the existing core development team and the growing number of users, project development is becoming unbalanced towards favoring maintenance and user support over new development.
Allowing for direct access to as many dominant users of pyhf as possible will allow for the developer team to reprioritize effort moving forward and establish a new development roadmap.
Similarly, bringing together as many particle physicists and research software engineers interested in contributing to pyhf development allows for an opportunity to educate new contributors on development goals, expand the developer team, and for the existing developer team to learn ways to improve the development workflow and contributor experience.

## Impact to the scientific ecosystem

In recent years particle physics as a field has shifted from using its own specialized open source software towards using more open source software from the broader scientific community.
This trend has been a net positive with a particular boon coming from developing common tools, built on top of broader scientific open source, across particle physics subfields and experiments &mdash; like pyhf.
The workshop benefits to the user community will have direct effects on the scientific work done by the users across particle physics.
Fostering the pyhf developer community across subfields also helps to bring software development improvements and best practices from the Scientific Python and Scikit-HEP organizations to more research groups.

## Impact to the community

Allowing for more researchers to attend the workshop allows for greater exposure of NumFOCUS projects, goals, and the organization to the broader particle physics community.
pyhf's exposure to NumFOCUS through participation in the SciPy conference since 2019 has directly motivated increased interaction and partnerships between the particle physics community and the SciPy Conference community, the Scientific Python organization, and NumFOCUS (two Scikit-HEP projects are now NumFOCUS Affiliated projects).
The workshop will offer additional opportunities for the pyhf development team to emphasize the impact and benefits of the NumFOCUS ecosystem and community to the participants which we hope will lead towards additional positive involvement of particle physicists with NumFOCUS's goals.

9. Amount Requested (Numbers only in USD)

10000

10. Brief Budget Justification: (Please include hours and/or pay rates) How will the money be spent?

To avoid having to pay University of Wisconsin-Madison Facilities & Administrative Costs ("overhead") rates of 26% of the Modified Total Direct Cost of the award for off campus programs we would request that NumFOCUS directly pay for expenses associated with the award to maximize utility.
Given this assumption, the requested award amount would be used in the following manner:

* A projected 900 USD would be used for professional human captioning of all recorded presentations as the workshop.
An upper bound estimate of the amount of recorded content would be 10 hours.
Rev.com (our preferred transcription service that we've used for years) charges $1.50 per minute for human captioning of English.
Rev.com charges no sales tax, so the estimate for captioning is based only on transcription time.
While machine learning based transcription exists for cheaper rates, these services still perform with a word error rate of more than 15% for typical human speech, which is an error
every 2.4 seconds (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08748).
This error rate provides unacceptable access to language for the deaf members of our community.
* 200 USD would be reserved for miscellaneous costs that would be incurred for workshop administration.
Examples of possible expenses include name badges, microphone batteries, ground transportation in Geneva.
* The remaining award, 8900 USD, would be used as travel support awards to workshop participants.
This would include international flights and possibly international European trains.
Travel support award amounts would be determined after registration for the workshop has closed to support the maximum number of attendees possible.

11. Timeline of Deliverables: Please include specific timelines showing when you will achieve the proposed work.

The main deliverable, the workshop itself, will take place in December 2023.
All video recordings of presentations at the workshop will be publicly posted and professionally captioned by the end of January 2024.
The summary report of the work deliverables and workshop outcomes will be submitted to NumFOCUS promptly within the alloted time.
