5. Proposal Title

pyhf Developer Community Workshop 2023

6. Two Sentence Summary of Proposal

Given the rise in adoption of pyhf usage across experimental and theoretical particle physics in multiple subfields (collider physics at the Large Hadron Collider, flavor physics, neutrino physics) the pyhf development team is holding the first pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/). This workshop would support the growth and empowerment of the particle physics developer community that contributes to pyhf development and would benefit from having costs offset by this award.

7. Description of Proposal. No more than 750 words (4,500 characters max).

(riffing here to get raw text down to revise later)
In 2018 the ATLAS collaboration at CERN used pyhf and its JSON model specification to publish the first full probability model of a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment.
Since then, the ATLAS collaboration has used pyhf in over 24 publications.
There has been steady adoption of pyhf across the broader particle physics community.
The IRIS-HEP software research institute has made it a core technology for data analysis.
The Belle II collaboration located in Japan has published multiple analyses using it.
Members of the particle physics theory community have adopted it for analysis.
The MicroBooNE experiment has begun to adopt it as well.

Through interacting with the users and contributors of the broader particle physics community it has become clear to the pyhf core development team that the use cases of the broader community are varied and there is an unused potential of strong software developers in the particle physics community.
To better facilitate inter-experimental discussions and to understand what will benefit the pyhf user community the most the pyhf development team will hold the first pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/).
Additionally, the workshop will be used to onboard new contributors and to have the explicit goal of growing the pyhf development team to better support new feature development.

As the users of pyhf are globally distributed the decision to hold a workshop at CERN was made as it is viewed as a common international meeting place and CERN users (all the core developers are CERN members or users) have the ability to book conference rooms at CERN without any room costs.

However, funding to travel to CERN globally is not always a given and is generally disproportionately represented from North American and European institutions.
We would like to facilitate travel support, with preference given to Ph.D. candidates and researchers at non-European or North American universities, to help create a more diverse representation.

Here discuss more about why funding is needed. Going to bed now.
