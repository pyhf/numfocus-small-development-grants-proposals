5. Proposal Title

pyhf Developer Community Workshop 2023

6. Two Sentence Summary of Proposal

Given the rise in adoption of pyhf usage across experimental and theoretical particle physics in multiple subfields (collider physics at the Large Hadron Collider, flavor physics, neutrino physics) the pyhf development team is holding the first pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/). This workshop would support the growth and empowerment of the particle physics developer community that contributes to pyhf development and would benefit from having costs offset by this award.

7. Description of Proposal. No more than 750 words (4,500 characters max).

## Motivation

The pyhf user community has grown extensively since the project inception in 2018, covering many different subfields of particle physics experiment, theory, and computation.
In 2019 the ATLAS collaboration at CERN (focused on high energy physics) used pyhf and its JSON model specification to publish the first full probability model of a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) analysis, and has since gone on to use pyhf in over 24 publications.
With this success, and pyhf's continued development, there has been wide adoption of pyhf in the broader particle physics community.
The Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) has adopted pyhf as a component of its plan for the next generation of particle physics analysis software.
Most recently, the Belle II experimental collaboration in Japan (focused on lower energy precision physics) has published multiple analyses using pyhf, and the MicroBooNE experimental collaboration (focused on neutrino physics) is also beginning to use pyhf.
The particle physics phenomenology theory community has also be quick adopters of pyhf, using the library as an inference engine to build their workflows around.
These communities represent a broad collection of subfields of particle physics, with different needs and goals, with hundreds of pyhf users each.

While the community of pyhf users has been steadily growing, the number of regular pyhf contributors has not grown substantially beyond the three core developers.
Through interacting with the users and contributors in the broader particle physics community it has become clear to the pyhf core development team that it is important for the project to better understand the varied needs of the users and seek additional project developers.
To better facilitate inter-experimental discussions and to understand what will benefit the pyhf user community the most the pyhf development team will hold the inaugural pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/).
Additionally, the workshop will be used to onboard new contributors and to have the explicit goal of growing the pyhf development team to better support new feature development.

## Planned work and costs

Particle physics workshops have a format of a small conference in which the first days contain introductory talks on the state of the field and demonstrations.
In addition to providing video recordings for these talks it is important that the recordings are professional captioned to make them accessible to the deaf members of our community, as well as more accessible in general.

The workshop will be split into two parts: A section focusing on the pyhf user community and a following section focused on growing the developer community.

The rest of the approximately week workshop will be devoted to planning discussions to better understand the needs of the user community, the

As the users of pyhf are globally distributed the decision to hold a workshop at CERN was made as it is a common international meeting place and CERN users (including the pyhf development team) are allowed to use CERN facilities and resources for meetings without any cost.
However, travel costs to CERN can be substantial, leading to CERN meeting attendance being disproportionately represented from larger European institutions.
To have a successful workshop with diverse user community representation we plan to use the majority of this award to provide travel support, with preference given to Ph.D. candidates and early career researchers at institutions outside of Europe.

## Risks

The risks for successful execution of the workshop are few, given the experience of the organizers in planning and executing similar workshops for many years and the communicated level of interest from the boarder particle physics community.
The primary risk would be lack of attendance and contributions from primary user groups in the community and groups that would be well suited to be new developers.
These risks will be mitigated by communicating in advance with the user groups and by advertising the workshop across the various particle physics community mailing lists and meetings, and the monthly NumFOCUS newsletter, at the end of Summer 2023.
