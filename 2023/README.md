5. Proposal Title

pyhf Users and Developers Workshop 2023

6. Two Sentence Summary of Proposal

Given the rise in adoption of pyhf across multiple subfields of experimental and theoretical particle physics the pyhf development team is holding the inaugural pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/).
This workshop will support the growth and empowerment of the particle physics developer community that contributes to pyhf development and would benefit from having costs offset by this award.

## Proposed project

The pyhf user community has grown extensively since the project's founding in 2018, covering many different subfields of particle physics experiment, theory, and computation.
The Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) has adopted pyhf as a component of its plan for the next generation of particle physics analysis software, helping to motivate continued feature development to support fully differentiable analysis workflows.
Large (hundreds to thousands of members) experimental collaborations, like the ATLAS collaboration at CERN in Switzerland and the Belle II collaboration at KEK in Japan, have adopted pyhf for performing statistical inference for their analyses and publishing full statistical models.
This has significantly increased the global user base, who possess a spectrum of technical skill levels and development experience, and motivated a focus on user support.
The particle physics phenomenology and theory communities have also been quick adopters of pyhf, using the library as an inference engine to build their reinterpretation frameworks on, motivating the pyhf development team to strongly prioritize the developer experience when working with pyhf.
These communities represent a diverse collection of subfields of particle physics, with different needs and goals, experience with scientific programming, and expectations and understanding of open source software.

While the community of pyhf users has been steadily growing, the number of regular pyhf contributors has not grown substantially beyond the three core developers.
Through interacting with the users and contributors in the broader particle physics community it has become clear to the pyhf core development team that it is important for the project to better understand the varied needs of the users and seek additional project developers.
To better facilitate inter-experimental and inter-subfield discussions and to understand what will benefit the pyhf user community the most the pyhf development team will hold the inaugural pyhf user and developer community workshop at CERN in December 2023 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1294577/).
Additionally, the workshop will be used to onboard new contributors and to have the explicit goal of growing the pyhf development team to better support new feature development and diverse community needs.
To make the workshop a successful investment in time and resources broad user and developer involvement will be required.
The workshop will be an in-person and online hybrid, but given the large dispersion of timezones covered by the communities in-person participation will be preferred.
The pyhf development team would use a NumFOCUS Small Development Grants award to maximize participation and accessibility of the content.

## Planned work and costs

In the broader particle physics community "workshops" have a format of a small conference with introductory plenaries and tutorials, topical parallel sessions, strategic planning sessions, and, when software focused, end with development sprints.
The pyhf workshop will follow a similar format, though the first half of the workshop will be focused on better understanding and supporting the user community, and the second half will be focused on enabling and growing the developer community.
The workshop will conclude with development sprints to efficiently onboard new developers and make progress towards the goals and problems clarified in the workshop.
In addition to providing public video recordings for all presentations it is important that the recordings are professionally captioned to make them accessible to the deaf members of our community, as well as more accessible in general.
While not the largest anticipated cost on an awarded grant, providing accessible language to all participants would be a priority.

As the users of pyhf are globally distributed the decision to hold a workshop at CERN was made as it is a common international meeting place and CERN users (including the pyhf development team) are allowed to use CERN facilities, resources, and IT support for meetings without cost.
However, travel costs to CERN can be substantial, leading to CERN meeting attendance being disproportionately represented from larger European institutions.
To have a successful workshop with diverse community representation we plan to use the majority of an award grant to provide travel support, with preference given to Ph.D. candidates and early career researchers at institutions outside of Europe.

## Risks

The risks for successful execution of the workshop are few, given the organizers' experience in planning and executing similar workshops for many years and the communicated level of interest from the broader particle physics community.
The primary risk would be lack of attendance and contributions from large user communities and lack of participation from user groups that could be empowered to become developers.
These risks will be mitigated by communicating in advance with the user groups and by advertising the workshop across the various particle physics community mailing lists and meetings, as well as the monthly NumFOCUS newsletter, at the end of Summer 2023.

DEBUG: REVISE

## Impact to the project

For pyhf the workshop offers an opportunity for synchronous interaction with the largest user groups and people most probable to continue making contributions and become future developers.
This is crucial for the continued development and growth of the project.
Given the limited time of the existing core development team, who are all professional academic physicists, and the growing number of users, project development is becoming unbalanced towards favoring maintenance and user support over new development.
Allowing for direct discussion with many dominant users of pyhf will greatly assist the developer team in reprioritizing efforts and establishing a new development roadmap.
Similarly, bringing together as many particle physicists and research software engineers interested in contributing to pyhf development allows for an opportunity to educate new contributors on development goals and best practices, expand the developer team, and learn ways to improve the development workflow and contributor experience.

## Impact to the scientific ecosystem

In recent years particle physics as a field has shifted from using its own specialized open source software towards using more shared open source software from the broader scientific community.
This trend has been a net positive for the field with a particular boon coming from developing common tools, built on top of broader scientific open source, across particle physics subfields and experiments &mdash; like pyhf.
The workshop benefits to the pyhf user community will have direct impacts on the scientific work done across particle physics.
Fostering the pyhf developer community across subfields also helps bring software development improvements and best practices from NumFOCUS communities, like Scientific Python organization, to more research groups.

## Impact to the community

Allowing for more researchers to attend the workshop allows for greater exposure of NumFOCUS projects, goals, and the organization to the broader particle physics community.
pyhf's exposure to NumFOCUS through participation in the SciPy conference since 2019 has directly motivated increased interaction and partnerships between the particle physics community and the SciPy Conference community, the Scientific Python organization, and NumFOCUS (two Scikit-HEP projects are now NumFOCUS Affiliated projects).
The workshop will offer additional opportunities for the pyhf development team to emphasize the impact and benefits of the NumFOCUS ecosystem and community to the participants which we hope will lead towards additional positive involvement of particle physicists with NumFOCUS's goals.

9. Amount Requested (Numbers only in USD)

10000

10. Brief Budget Justification: (Please include hours and/or pay rates) How will the money be spent?

To avoid having to pay University of Wisconsin-Madison Facilities & Administrative Costs ("overhead") rates of 26% of the Modified Total Direct Cost of the award for off campus programs we would request that NumFOCUS directly pay for expenses associated with the award to maximize utility.
Given this assumption, the requested award amount would be used in the following manner:

* A projected 900 USD would be used for professional human captioning of all recorded presentations as the workshop.
An upper bound estimate of the amount of recorded content would be 10 hours.
Rev.com (our preferred transcription service that we've used for years) charges $1.50 per minute for human captioning of English.
Rev.com charges no sales tax, so the estimate for captioning is based only on transcription time.
While machine learning based transcription exists for cheaper rates, these services still perform with a word error rate of more than 15% for typical human speech, which is an error
every 2.4 seconds (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08748).
This error rate provides unacceptable access to language for the deaf members of our community.
* 200 USD would be reserved for miscellaneous costs that would be incurred for workshop administration.
Examples of possible expenses include name badges, microphone batteries, ground transportation in Geneva.
* The remaining award, 8900 USD, would be used as travel support awards to workshop participants.
This would include international flights and possibly international European trains.
Travel support award amounts would be determined after registration for the workshop has closed to support the maximum number of attendees possible.

11. Timeline of Deliverables: Please include specific timelines showing when you will achieve the proposed work.

The main deliverable, the workshop itself, will take place in December 2023.
All video recordings of presentations at the workshop will be publicly posted and professionally captioned by the end of January 2024.
The summary report of the work deliverables and workshop outcomes will be submitted to NumFOCUS promptly within the alloted time.
