# NumFOCUS Small Development Grants Call for Proposals

NumFOCUS is pleased to invite proposals for our 2nd round of Small Development Grants for 2023!

Apply Here: https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/mbtH7w

Timeline:
* **Deadline for Proposal Submission: June 16, 2023**
* Projects will be Notified: July 28th, 2023 (or sooner)

Available Funding:
* Up to $10,000 per proposal

Eligibility:
* Any NumFOCUS Fiscally Sponsored or Affiliated project may submit one proposal on behalf of the project per grant cycle.
   - If you would like to solicit proposal ideas from your project community, the project leaders will need to organize their own review process to select the proposal that the leadership will put forward to NumFOCUS.
* Funding can be used for code development, documentation work; website updates; workshops and sprints; educational, sustainability, and diversity initiatives, or other types of projects.
* Proposed work must be achievable within the 12 months following the award.
* The call is open to applicants from any nationality and can be performed at any university, institute, or business worldwide (US export laws permitting).

Funding Distribution:
* For fiscally sponsored projects only, NumFOCUS can **deposit the grant funding directly into the projectâ€™s account**. The project would then submit invoices through the usual channels (i.e., Open Collective) to pay the grant expenses.
* NumFOCUS can set up an **independent contractor agreement** with an individual or company.
* NumFOCUS can award the money as a **grant or subcontract to a student or postdoc at a university** (depending on the university's rules).
* NumFOCUS can **directly pay for expenses** associated with the grant (e.g. booking flights on behalf of project leaders to attend a workshop, per diems for travel days)
